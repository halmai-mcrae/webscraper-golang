# Web Scraping with Golang

This basic HTML web scraper was created to introduce myself to some of the GO fundamentals and expand my skills.
I am in the early stage of learning GO but so far I find it fast, well-scaled and fairly easy to pick up!

* Used a web scraping framework called Colly - [http://go-colly.org/](http://go-colly.org/) to extract some data from a test site.
